# Machine Learning Demo

This repository contains various machine learning models and implementations that can be run in Google Colab.

## Setup Instructions for Google Colab

1. **Open Google Colab**
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
   - Create a new notebook

2. **Upload the Notebook**
   - In Google Colab, go to File > Upload notebook
   - Select the notebook file

3. **Runtime Configuration**
   - For faster training, use GPU runtime:
     - Go to Runtime > Change runtime type
     - Select GPU as the Hardware accelerator
   - For CPU-only models:
     - Select CPU as the Hardware accelerator

## Usage

1. **Running Notebooks**
   - Run all cells in sequence using Runtime > Run all
   - Or run cells individually using Shift + Enter
   - Use Runtime > Restart runtime if you need to start fresh

2. **Saving Work**
   - Save your work regularly using File > Save
   - Download the notebook using File > Download > Download .ipynb

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor your Colab usage in the top-right corner
   - Disconnect and delete runtime when done to free up resources
   - Use GPU runtime only when necessary

2. **Performance Tips**
   - Keep your browser tab active during long training sessions
   - Use smaller batch sizes if you encounter memory issues
   - Consider using Google Drive for storing large datasets

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. **Runtime Issues**
   - Restart the runtime (Runtime > Restart runtime)
   - Check if you have the correct runtime type selected
   - Verify you have sufficient Colab runtime memory

2. **Import Errors**
   - Install missing packages using:
     ```python
     !pip install package_name
     ```
   - Restart runtime after installing new packages

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Clear output and variables
   - Restart runtime if needed

## Notes

- Colab sessions may disconnect after periods of inactivity
- GPU runtime is not always available (depends on Colab's current capacity)
- Some notebooks may require specific versions of libraries
